# crypto-web-scraping

Project made by following this tutorial: https://blog.octachart.com/a-practical-introduction-to-web-scraping-with-python#heading-what-is-web-scraping

The `CryptoScraper` class crawls the `https://www.investing.com/crypto/currencies` webpage, scrapes the rank, name, symbol, and market cap of the top 100 Cryptocurrencies, then outputs the results into a CSV file.
